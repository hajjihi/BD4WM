Using Spark RRD, Spark SQL and SparkR (1.5 version) for handling Water Big Data 
- Water Smart Metering Data (Smart Metering Information Portal):  2246 files (1.4 Gb) downloaded from  SMIP https://code.google.com/p/smart-meter-information-portal/downloads/detail?name=SMIPsampledata.tar.gz&can=2&q=
- Weather Station Data (EUROPEAN CLIMATE ASSESSMENT & DATASET) : excerpt of 491 files (296 Mb) : downloaded from http://eca.knmi.nl/dailydata/predefinedseries.php

The code contain three directories, each one handling those datasets with one of the following techniques:
Spark RDD, Spark SQL(for the Water Smart Metering data) 
SparkR (for the Water Smart Metering data) : with StudioR Configurations properties
Spark RDD , Spark SQL (for the Weather Station data)


Comming soon: A very detailed tutorial explaing the code will be included in this Github project
